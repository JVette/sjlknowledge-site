This site is to be used for educational and informational purposes. 

Welcome to the Louisville Justice Site, a site specifically for folks who are currently doing movement, grassroots, activism, social justice, or other liberation work for marginalized people.

This site has been created for individuals seeking to get involved and/or to get more information on who is active in this community sector in the Louisville Metro area.  This site is for collaboration, information, education, and a kind of a one-stop-shop for all things justice in the Louisville Metro and surrounding areas.  

I only got the chance to add three groups, some events, and some history but there are several groups I will be adding to this site.  Unfortunately, I did not have time for the purposes of this project.  Before the website goes "live" all groups highlighted will be asked permission to use their materials.  If they say no, I will not use them. 

Other orgs include:
Fairness Campaign
Indivisible KY
Louisville Showing Up for Racial Justice (LSURJ)
Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)
Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Oppression
NAACP
Louisville Urban League
Mijente
Parents for Social Justice
KY Commission on Human Rights
Young Somalis for Louisville
Jobs With Justice KY
The Muslim Community Center of Louisville
National Lawyers Guild 
Fellowship of Reconciliation (FORsooth)
and several more.
